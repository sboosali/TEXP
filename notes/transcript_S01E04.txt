Coroner [01:41.97]: You know what the average life expectancy on Earth is?
Miller [01:44.77]: No.
Coroner [01:45.85]: 123 years. It's even better on Mars.
Coroner [01:48.19]: You know what it is on Ceres? 68.
Coroner [01:51.65]: And with the recent unpleasantness, that average is only going down.
Miller [01:57.03]: What?
Coroner [01:58.16]: Nothing. I'm sure you're younger than you look.
Coroner [02:08.13]: Stiff's ID is Bizi Betiko.
Coroner [02:10.67]: You know, there is no religious directive on file, so, okay if I recycle him?
Coroner [02:14.46]: Factory on 39 needs some fertilizer.
Miller [02:16.76]: Not yet.
Amos [02:30.02]: I'd like to know what the hell Holden is discussing with the Captain right now.
Shed [02:33.44]: For all we know, he could be working out a deal.
Naomi [02:35.40]: Yeah, for himself.
Holden [02:40.45]: The only thing I see here is an incoming ship.
Holden [02:44.45]: One you can't even identify.
Holden [02:47.58]: How do you know they're coming for Naomi?
Yao [02:50.29]: We don't. It's a guess.
Holden [02:52.88]: And you're just guessing Naomi's OPA, too.
Lopez [2:55.59]: We both know that's better than a guess.
Lopez [2:58.72]: She is the best liar amongst all of you, by far.
Lopez [03:02.01]: And she is hiding something. You can sense that, too.
Holden [3:06.43]: I don't believe she's a terrorist and even if she was, I'm not blaming her for the Canterbury.
Yao [03:11.77]: You blamed it on us.
Holden [3:12.90]: We found Martian naval tech in the beacon that lured us to the Scopuli, and then you showed up.
Yao [03:17.28]: We had nothing to do with the Canterbury but, because of you, Earth thinks we destroyed it. Some people are calling it an act of war.
Yao [03:26.54]: You need to recant.
Lopez [03:26.54]: Blame Nagata. True or not, it will change the narrative until cooler heads prevail and figure out what really happened.
Holden [3:36.30]: I won't do it. There's some kind of game being played here.
Holden [3:40.22]: Maybe someone wants a war, I don't know but, if you really do want to stop it, then let us go and then we talk.
Weapons Officer [03:45.72]: Captain, inbound vessel approaching defense perimeter. One minute to contact.
Yao [03:49.23]: Hail them.
Sensor/Comms Officer [3:49.23]: Frequencies open.
Yao [03:51.14]: Unidentified vessel, this is Captain Theresa Yao, of the MCRN Donnager. This is your final warning. If you maintain your present course you will be fired upon.
Sensor/Comms Officer [4:00.82]: [HIGH-PITCHED BUZZING]They're jamming us.
Weapons Officer [4:17.00]: Multiple fast movers detected!
Sensor/Comms Officer [04:18.63]: More than one ship. I count six bandits.
Weapons Officer [4:23.76]: Missile launch alert.

Alex [04:32.19]: That's battle mode lighting. Must be a drill.
Shed [4:38.32]: (FIRING)Okay, what's that?
Alex [04:40.74]: It sounds like torpedoes being fired.
Amos [04:44.66]: Sounds like a lot of torpedoes.
Alex [04:46.28]: I don't think it's a drill.
Shed [04:49.20]: Maybe, we should get strapped in.
Naomi [04:51.20]: Good idea.
Weapons Officer [05:11.06]: Torpedoes are away! Guidance lock on all targets.

Souther [05:48.30]: we can't resolve the drive signatures or make any visual IDs.
Avasarala [5:51.01]: They took our people hostage. We have to get a ship there.
Souther [05:54.94]: The Orinoco's en route at best possible speed, but they're still two days out.
Avasarala [05:58.19]: It'll all be over by then. Somebody has a new fleet of warships.
Souther [06:02.82]: I concur. Any idea who it might be?

Yao [06:31.89]: You look nervous.
Holden [06:33.72]: I get that way when missiles are flying at me.
Yao [06:37.64]: Don't worry. It's nothing our guns can't handle.
Yao [06:40.86]: I take it you didn't see much action in the UN Navy?
Holden [06:43.40]: That was a good thing.
Yao [06:43.40]: Not for soldiers.
Yao [6:47.61]: The only combat most of my officers have seen is in simulators.
Yao [6:51.74]: Fortunately, I got to spend three years cleansing the Belt of pirates who were poaching terraforming supplies intended for Mars.
Yao [7:00.50]: I'm sure they weren't all bad people but, sometimes you have to kill to preserve.
Yao [07:03.34]:
Woman #1 [7:06.21]: [On PA]Captain Yao, you're needed on Comms deck two.

Grandson [07:24.73]: Appa says you shouldn't be on the roof.
Avasarala [07:28.03]: And you should?
Grandson [07:41.25]: They're nothing to be scared of, you know. They're just little rocks that burn up in the sky.
Avasarala [07:46.05]: They're not always so little.
Grandson [07:49.55]: You mean like the one that killed the dinosaurs?
Avasarala [07:53.05]: Uh-huh.
Grandson [07:55.06]: Okay, that rock was big but, that hardly ever happens. Like winning the lottery.
Avasarala [8:04.06]: I worry about people who throw rocks.
Grandson [08:07.73]: [(SCOFFS)]Nobody could throw rocks that big.
Grandson [08:10.40]: It just happens, sometimes, because, you know, gravity.
Avasarala [08:14.57]: Hmm.
Grandson [08:16.53]: Come in and play.

Lopez [08:33.93]: May I ask you a question?
Lopez [08:37.60]: Do you miss Earth?
Holden [08:39.77]: If I did, I'd go back.
Lopez [08:43.10]: My great-uncle emigrated from Earth.
Lopez [08:46.31]: He missed it terribly.
Lopez [08:48.44]: He used to tell me stories when I was a little boy about these endless blue skies, free air everywhere. Open water all the way to the horizon.
Lopez [08:59.95]: He told me that someday we would make Mars just like that.
Lopez [09:03.83]: When you spend your whole life living under a dome, even the idea of an ocean seems impossible to imagine.
Lopez [09:14.93]: I could never understand your people.
Lopez [09:17.47]: Why, when the universe had bestowed so much upon you, you seemed to care so little for it.
Holden [09:22.18]: Wrecking things is what Earthers do best.
Holden [09:26.60]: Martians, too, by the look of your ship.
Lopez [09:29.61]: We are nothing like you.
Lopez [09:32.24]: The only things Earthers care about is government handouts. Free food, free water, free drugs so that you can forget the aimless lives you lead.
Lopez [09:40.99]: You're short-sighted and selfish, and it will destroy you.
Weapons Officer [09:45.46]: Incoming torpedoes in PDC range, one minute.
Lopez [09:50.63]: Earth is over, Mr. Holden. My only hope is that we can bring Mars to life before you destroy that, too.

Mormon Elder [15:09.66]: There have been rumblings that you should be replaced as Head of Operations for the project.
Fred [15:25.00]: Why is that?
Mormon Elder [15:27.34]: Your ties to the OPA have been making a number of Elders in the general authorities uncomfortable, particularly in light of the recent events in the Belt.
Fred [15:34.47]: The OPA is only interested in human rights and jobs for all Belters.
Mormon Elder [15:40.44]: And fomenting riots on Ceres and inflaming passions in the wake of the Canterbury. (EXHALES)
Fred [15:45.07]: The history of organized religion isn't exactly strife-free.

Fred [15:55.37]: Of course. If that's what you want.
Fred [15:58.62]: ...but, I'd be remiss if I didn't remind you that, without me, you're going to have a very difficult time retaining the most skilled Belters for your project. I mean the ones who build for reliability.
Fred [16:10.84]: You're about to send your best and brightest Mormons on a hundred-year voyage to a new world around a new sun. Who knows what tragic malfunctions might occur along the way?
Fred [16:26.69]: So who'd you have in mind?
Mormon Elder [16:33.57]: We're still weighing our options.

Miller [28:41.22]: Here we go.
$. [28:47.26]: (BEEPING)
$. [29:03.45]: (BEEP S)
$. [29:06.87]: Damn it.(CLEARS THROAT)
Miller [29:09.29]: Well, it's not like I'm hurting the guy.
$. [29:18.42]: There.
$. [29:20.34]: Bingo.
Muss [29:35.06]: Content's encrypted, obviously. But, judging by the file names, these are government records.
$. [29:37.27]:
$. [29:39.52]: Okay.
$. [29:40.78]: Customs documents, corporate R&D...
$. [29:44.03]: This guy was a data broker.
$. [29:45.82]: Oh.
$. [29:47.03]: Well, whatever he brokered,
$. [29:50.37]: must have been important enough to get him killed.
Muss [29:52.58]: What're you not telling me?
Miller [29:52.58]: Nothing.
Muss [29:55.83]: Miller.
Miller [29:59.67]: It's better if you don't know.
Muss [30:01.88]: I don't need you to protect me.
Miller [30:03.34]: I'm not protecting you.
$. [30:05.72]: (LAUGHS)
I...
Muss [30:07.30]: I hate it when you do this.
$. [30:14.73]: Thanks.
Miller [30:17.31]: Havelock.
$. [30:18.77]: (HAND TERMINAL RINGING)
Come on.
$. [30:21.32]: (BEEP S)
Miller [30:22.61]: All right. Leave him a message.
Miller [30:26.49]: Hey, look, um...
Miller [30:28.82]: I don't care if you're up to your whatever in whoever,
$. [30:31.58]: but when you come up for air,
$. [30:33.37]: I'm gonna need you to cover for me with Shaddid, okay?
$. [30:36.21]: I can't give you any details, but just use your imagination, all right?
$. [30:40.96]: I know you can be a devious son of a bitch when you want to be.
$. [30:44.13]: I'd do the same for you.
Brothel Madam [30:53.77]: (GASPS)
Brothel Madam [30:55.60]: Oh shit! Shit! I'll get help!
Brothel Madam [30:59.90]: Somebody help! This officer needs help!

$. [32:20.81]: (GUN FIRING)
(GRUNTS)
$. [32:26.19]: (PANTING)
Grimes [32:29.86]: His weapon is keyed to his armor, he couldn't have fired it.
Grimes [32:33.45]: You're welcome.
Dookie [32:34.53]: Mole's dead, asshole.
Holden [32:39.70]: I'm sorry, I really am. But I won't testify to anything
$. [32:45.04]: unless you help me get my friends off this ship.
Lopez [32:47.17]: Shut up. I want to speak to him.
Grimes [32:47.17]: Yes, sir.
$. [32:51.22]: He doesn't look like any OPA grunt I've ever seen. Tech is way too advanced.
$. [32:56.05]: (BEEPING)
Yours.
$. [33:01.73]: Who are you working for? Why did you destroy the Canterbury?
$. [33:06.69]: Phoebe Station. Were you there?
$. [33:09.23]: You were. What happened?
$. [33:13.20]: Listen to me very carefully. If you want medical attention, you start speaking now.
Boarder [33:16.83]: We'll all be dead soon enough.
Holden [33:26.08]: Let's go. Please. You have to help me get my friends. You wouldn't leave one of yours behind.
Holden [33:30.17]:
$. [33:31.80]: We're Marines. We've sworn to die for each other if we have to.
$. [33:35.76]: You barely know those other people.
$. [33:37.35]: They're only here because of me.
Holden [33:41.73]: I'll make you a deal.
$. [33:45.15]: (BEEP S)
Holden [33:56.95]: Oh, Shed.
Naomi [34:00.24]: [COUGHING]
$. [34:04.79]: Hey, are you okay?
(COUGHS)
$. [34:07.83]: (GASPS FOR BREATH AND COUGHS)
$. [34:09.75]: You came back?
$. [34:11.80]: Of course I did.
$. [34:12.88]: The deal is this.
$. [34:14.97]: You will all testify that Mars had nothing to do
$. [34:17.47]: with theCanterbury's destruction.
$. [34:19.60]: Suit up fast, the air seal is temporary. We have to move.
Holden [34:23.93]: What's wrong with Alex? AMOS:
He took one for the team.
Amos [34:27.31]: I'll carry him.
$. [34:33.03]: (COUGHS)
Amos [34:34.40]: Come on, buddy. We gotta suit up.
Lopez [34:41.58]: We can't get pinned down again, we need a clear route to the hangar bay.
Grimes [34:45.54]: I'm trying, sir, but our ship is crawling with scumbags.
Holden [34:48.38]: Lopez.
Holden [34:51.80]: Listen.
Holden [34:53.46]: We've all lost people we care about. And I don't even have a clue as to why.
Holden [34:57.68]: But I keep hearing about Phoebe Station.
Holden [34:59.59]: And if we're all going to die because of it,
Holden [35:01.14]: can't you at least tell me what the hell happened there?
Lopez [35:05.02]: Donnager was dispatched to Phoebe Station after she went silent for several weeks.
Holden [35:09.65]: Why?
$. [35:11.11]: We still don't know.
$. [35:13.36]: Everyone on board was dead. Their bodies were incinerated.
$. [35:16.86]: We found them re-frozen to the walls of the ice tunnels.
$. [35:19.70]: We thought it was a fire or a chemical spill,
$. [35:21.37]: but then we discovered that all the computer cores were destroyed.
$. [35:24.37]: You mean someone did it deliberately?
$. [35:27.04]: They were covering something up.
$. [35:29.96]: Like what? I don't know.
$. [35:32.21]: (BEEPING)
$. [35:36.38]: Jesus.
$. [35:42.51]: What happened?
Lopez [35:44.43]: The Captain has set Condition Zero. She's going to scuttle the ship.
$. [35:53.06]: (RATTLING)
$. [35:57.24]: MAN: Hull breach, deck four, critical.
$. [35:59.57]: Boarders are converging on engineering, aux, CIC and the bridge.
$. [36:03.53]: Has the ready standby left the hangar bay?
$. [36:05.08]: MAN: Negative, sir. It's still there.
$. [36:15.88]: Captain. Not yet.
Yao [36:18.26]: This has to count for something.
Dookie [36:27.39]: Dookie ready.
Grimes [36:28.98]: Grimes in position.
Holden [36:40.82]: Mag boots off. Move as fast as you can.
$. [36:45.70]: Everybody on my mark. Standby for cover fire.
$. [36:48.62]: Uh-huh.
$. [36:50.12]: Hey, hey! Don't you quit on me.
$. [36:53.88]: All right.
Naomi [36:56.04]: Ready?
Lopez [36:58.21]: GO!
$. [37:07.26]: (GUNSHOTS)
$. [37:10.02]: (SCREAMS)
$. [37:18.40]: (GRUNTS)

$. [38:35.89]: (GROANS)
$. [38:42.61]: What the hell are we supposed to do now?
$. [38:49.99]: What about the others?
Lopez [38:51.33]: They're gone.
We have to dust off now.
$. [39:00.92]: (SCREAMS IN PAIN)
Lopez [39:09.93]: I'm not a pilot. Someone else needs to fly.
Alex [39:18.19]: What? Whoa!
Holden [39:18.19]: Go. Go!
Lopez [39:25.44]: Authorize full operational control of all systems for everyone now on board.
$. [39:30.82]: (GRUNTS)
Alex [39:32.78]: Boss, I don't think I'm in any condition to...
Holden [39:34.62]: Get us out of here!
Alex [39:34.62]: You got it.
Alex [39:41.08]: I need some juice.
$. [39:48.30]: (EXHALES)
Alex [39:53.51]: Okay, sweetheart, be gentle with me.
Alex [39:57.77]: This is my first time.
$. [40:09.36]: (GUNS FIRING)
$. [40:33.85]: (GRUNTS) Sorry.
Lopez [40:43.52]: Evasive maneuvers. Max burn.
Lopez [40:46.90]: Do not let anyone stay on our tail.
Alex [40:49.32]: You got it, Hoss. I mean... Yes, sir.
Lopez [40:58.37]: It would've been nice to see an ocean on Mars.
$. [41:17.72]: MAN: The Tachi is away.
Sir.
$. [41:20.06]: Captain, this door won't hold much longer.
Yao [41:24.31]: I didn't think we could lose.
$. [41:37.49]: (EXPLODING)
$. [41:50.96]: (ALEX EXCLAIMS)
$. [41:52.22]: I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
